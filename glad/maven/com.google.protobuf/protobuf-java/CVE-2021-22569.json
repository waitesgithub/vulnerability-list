  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-22569",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/com.google.protobuf/protobuf-java",
  "Title": "Denial of Service",
  "Description": "An issue in protobuf-java allowed the interleaving of `com.google.protobuf.UnknownFieldSet` fields in such a way that would be processed out of order. A small malicious payload can occupy the parser for several minutes by creating large numbers of short-lived objects that cause frequent, repeated pauses. We recommend upgrading libraries beyond the vulnerable versions.",
